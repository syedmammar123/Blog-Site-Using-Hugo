# Introduction to CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

## Basic Syntax

CSS is a rule-based language. You define rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page.

### Example

Here is a simple example of a CSS rule:

```css
body {
    background-color: lightblue;
}
h1 {
    color: white;
    text-align: center;
}
p {
    font-family: verdana;
    font-size: 20px;
}
